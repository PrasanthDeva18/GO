Pointer in GO
pointers are used to store variables address

Why we use pointers?
Avoid unneccessary value copies
directy mutate values

Avoid unneccessary value copies

by default, go creates a copy when passing values to function

for very large and complex values this may take up too much memory space unneccessarily

how ->

in go program, pass the variable to the function arguments, go creates the values of that variable
garbage collector removed unused values

with pointers only one value is stored in memory


pass a pointer intead of a value to a function
the function can then directly edit the underlying value - no return value is required
can lead to less code

in variable default value is there it will be called as null value

for the pointers it was call it as nil value -> nill value means absence of address value.


in go, we cant able to perform pointer arithmetic calculation
